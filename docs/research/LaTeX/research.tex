\section*{Introduction}

In the recent years, the increasing usage of the Internet has lead to a rapid
expansion of data collection and processing\cite{khan2014big}. As concerns
regarding data privacy and protection grew, the European Union (EU) implemented
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May
2018\cite{greengard2018weighing, historyGdpr}.

GDPR aimed to safeguard the privacy rights of individuals within the EU by
regulating the collection, storage, and transfer of personal
data\cite{historyGdpr}. Notably, data should be collected for specified,
explicit and legitimate purposes\cite{europeanParliamentGdprArticle5} and data
can be transferred outside the EU if general data processing principles are in
place \cite{europeanParliamentGdprArticle44}. Compliance with GDPR has become a
critical issue for big-tech companies, which often handle massive amounts of
user data.

One of those companies is \textit{Meta Platforms, Inc.} (formerly
\textit{Facebook, Inc.}), which has been fined numerous times for GDPR
violations\cite{mrevzar2023analysis}. This has raised questions about the impact
of GDPR on \textit{Meta's} performance.

The goal of this paper is to investigate the financial impact of GDPR
non-compliance on \textit{Meta Platforms, Inc.} and to determine whether it is
profitable for the company to continue violating the regulations.

\section*{Method}

All numerical data about \textit{Meta Platforms, Inc.} has been gathered from
the official \textit{Meta Investor Relations} website\cite{fbMetaFinancials} -
\textbf{Balance Sheet}, \textbf{Income Statement} and \textbf{Form 10-Q}.

GDPR fines imposed on \textit{Meta Platforms, Inc.} have been gathered from the
\textit{GDPR Enforcement Tracker}
website\cite{enforcementtrackerGDPREnforcement} and filtered to include fines
imposed on their family of applications (\textbf{\textit{Facebook}},
\textbf{\textit{WhatsApp}}, \textbf{\textit{Instagram}}) and
\textbf{\textit{Meta Platforms, Inc.}} itself.
