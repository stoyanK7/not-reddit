\section*{Introduction}

In the recent years, the increasing usage of the Internet has lead to a rapid
expansion of data collection and processing\cite{}. As concerns regarding data
privacy and protection grew, the European Union (EU) implemented the General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018\cite{}.

GDPR aimed to safeguard the privacy rights of individuals within the EU by
regulating the collection, storage, and transfer of personal data\cite{}.
Notably, data should be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate
purposes\cite{} and data can be transferred outside the EU if general data
processing principles are in place \cite{}. Compliance with GDPR has become a
critical issue for big-tech companies, which often handle massive amounts of
user data.

One of those companies is \textit{Meta Platforms, Inc.} (formerly
\textit{Facebook, Inc.}), which has been fined numerous times for GDPR
violations and amounts for more than half of the total currency value of all
GDPR fines\cite{}. The company has also faced legal challenges and public
backlash over its data collection practices\cite{}. This has raised questions
about the financial impact of GDPR non-compliance on \textit{Meta Platforms,
Inc.} and whether it is profitable for the company to continue violating the
regulation.

\section*{Method}

Most of the numerical data is coming from the Meta Investor Relations
website\cite{}. 

This research is also following the protocol of Prisma flowchart for systematic
reviews\cite{}. Google Scholar was used to search for articles containing the
keywords above. The first 360 results were considered. The articles were
filtered by relevance following their titles and 60 were considered. The
abstracts of the 60 articles were read and X were considered
