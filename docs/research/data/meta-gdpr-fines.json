    "violation": "Insufficient fulfilment of information obligations",
    "summary": "The Irish DPA (DPC) has imposed a fine of EUR 225,000,000 on WhatsApp Ireland Ltd. The DPA had started extensive investigations into the messaging service's compliance with transparency obligations back in December 2018. In this context, the DPC investigated whether WhatsApp complied with its obligations under the GDPR regarding the provision of information and the transparency of this information to users and non-users of WhatsApp. \n\nIn the course of the investigation, the DPC found that WhatsApp had committed serious violations of Art. 12 GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR and Art. 14 GDPR with respect to the information provided to users. \n\nFollowing the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to other affected European supervisory authorities in December 2020. The DPC subsequently received objections from eight supervisory authorities. Due to lack of agreement, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure pursuant to Art. 65 GDPR on June 3, 2021. \n\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPB), by its decision of July 28, 2021, then, required the DPC to reassess and increase its proposed fine based on a number of factors. The EDPS found a violation of the principle of transparency set forth in Article 5(1) a) of the GDPR in addition to the violations found by the DPC, and requested this to be reflected in the final amount of the fine. \n\nBased on this, the DPC imposed the fine in the amount of EUR 225,000,000. \n\nThe fine is composed as follows:\n\nEUR 90,000,000 for the violation of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR;\nEUR 30,000,000 for the violation of Art. 12 GDPR;\nEUR 30,000,000 for the violation of Art. 13 GDPR; and\nEUR 75,000,000 for the violation of Art. 14 GDPR.\n\n\nWith respect to Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 13 GDPR, the DPC found that WhatsApp had failed to provide information about the nature of the data collection 'in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.' This includes making the information easy for children to understand when it is addressed to them. For example, WhatsApp had distributed information about the relationship between WhatsApp and other Facebook companies and the sharing of data under that relationship through a variety of texts. Much of the information provided was of such general nature, moreover, that the DPC deemed it meaningless. Users often had to overcome multiple links to FAQs to get to the information they were looking for on WhatsApp's website. In this regard, the DPC stated that it would be unreasonable to expect users to search the WhatsApp website after failing to find sufficient information in the privacy statement itself.\n\nWith regard to Art. 14 GDPR, one of the issues was the impact of a user's consent allowing the messaging platform to have access to his or her contacts. As such, the company searched its users' contact information on their phones for phone numbers and other data, not only from other WhatsApp users, but also from contacts who do not even have a WhatsApp account. The DPC finds that this data had been processed unlawfully, as these contacts (especially those who do not have a WhatsApp account) had not received any information about this processing and therefore could not possibly have given their consent. \n\nGiven the seriousness and the far-reaching nature and impact of the breaches, the DPA concluded that there had also been a violation of the transparency principle from Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR.",

Rather, several clicks were required to reject all cookies, in contrast to a single click to accept them.\n\nFrom this, the CNIL concluded that users would accept the deposit of cookies out of convenience with more frequency. It considered that the design of the cookie deposit interferes with the freedom of consent of Internet users and constitutes a violation of Art. 82 of the French Law on Informatics and Freedoms.\n\nIn determining the fine, the fact that a large number of people were affected was taken into account in an aggravating manner. In addition, the CNIL took into account the significant profits that the companies were able to make from the advertising revenue generated indirectly from the data collected through cookies.\n\nThe CNIL also pointed to the fact that the authority had already alerted the the company to this breach in February 2021. \n\nIn addition to the fine, the CNIL issued an order requiring the companies to provide Internet users in France with a way to reject cookies as easily as they can accept them, within three months of being notified of the decision. Otherwise, companies would face the payment of a penalty of EUR 100,000 per day of delay.",

In the course of its investigation, the DPC found that Meta failed to demonstrate that it had taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data of EU users. \n\nThe fine proceedings involved cross-border data processing, which is why the decision was subject to the co-decision procedure under Art. 60 GDPR involving all other European supervisory authorities as co-decision-makers.
