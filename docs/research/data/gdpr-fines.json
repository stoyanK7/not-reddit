Additionally, the company had not established and documented deadlines for deletion of personal data in their new CRM system. The deadlines set for the old system were not deleted after the deadline for the information had been reached. Also, the controller had not adequately documented its personal data deletion procedures. \r\n\r\nPlease note: Since Danish law does not provide for administrative fines as in the GDPR (unless it is an uncomplicated case and the accused person consented), fines will be imposed by courts. \r\n\r\nUpdate: On February 12, 2021 the Aarhus District Court decided to impose a fine against IDdesign in the amount of EUR 13,450. With regard to the calculation of the fine, the court disagreed with the proposed amount of the fine. It concluded that the amount should be calculated on the basis of the company's own turnover and not that of the entire group. In addition, the court considered that the mitigating circumstances under Art. 83 (2) GDPR should be taken into account when calculating the fine. Such as that the company had not previously breached the GDPR, as well as that the breach concerned only general personal data. In addition, no data subject suffered damages as a result of the breach. Finally, the court considers that the negligent nature of the breach should be taken into account.",

    "summary": "The fine was imposed in relation to a data subject's request for data correction and erasure. NAIH levied a fine against an unnamed financial institution for unlawfully rejecting a customer’s request to have his phone number erased after arguing that it was in the company's legitimate interest to process this data in order to enforce a debt claim against the customer. In its decision, the NAIH emphasised that the customer’s phone number is not necessary for the purpose of debt collection because the creditor can also communicate with the debtor by post. Consequently, keeping the phone number of the debtor was against the principles of data minimisation and purpose limitation. As per the law, the assessed fine was based on 0.025% of the company's annual net revenue.",

As mandated by law, the fine was based on 4% of the party's annual turnover and 2.65 % of its anticipated turnover for the coming year.\r\n\r\nThe breach was the result of a cyber attack by an anonymous hacker who accessed and disclosed information on the vulnerability of the organisation’s system – a database of more than 6,000 individuals – and the command used for the attack.

It is worth it to mention that the proceeding initiated before May 2018, but the Italian data protection authority issued a fine under the GDPR since the Rousseau platform had not adopted security measures required by means of an order issued after the 25th of May 2018. Interestingly, the fine was not issued against the Movimento 5 Stelle that is the data controller of the platform, but against the Rousseau association that is the data processor.",

The authority verified incompliance with the information obligation in relation to natural persons conducting business activity – entrepreneurs who are currently conducting such activity or have suspended it, as well as entrepreneurs who conducted such activity in the past. The controller fulfilled the information obligation by providing the information required under Art. 14 (1) – (3) of the GDPR only in relation to the persons whose e-mail addresses it had at its disposal. In case of the remaining persons the controller failed to comply with the information obligation – as it explained in the course of the proceedings – due to high operational costs. Therefore, it presented the information clause only on its website. According to the UODO this is not sufficient.\n\nAddendum: In the meantime, the court has cancelled the fine due to procedural errors. The amount of the fine has to be determined by the concrete number of data records concerned. However, the Office had not submitted any verifiable evidence in this regard, but had simply assumed that 6 million data sets were involved, which the data controller had denied. Therefore, important statements were missing. In particular, it was incorrect to justify the amount of the fine on the basis of general preventive considerations. Art. 58 GDPR expressly states that a fine imposed must be related to the specific facts of the case. The Polish data protection authority has already announced that the fine will be revised in a new administrative procedure.",

It concluded that although the infringement was finally removed, it was of a serious nature.However, when imposing a penalty, the President of the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection also took into account mitigating circumstances, such as good cooperation between the controller and the supervisory authority or lack of evidence that damage had been caused to the persons whose data had been disclosed.",

When determening the amount of the fine, the CNIL took into account the size (9 employees) and the financial situation of the company, which presented a negative net result in 2017 (turnover of 885,739 EUR in 2017 and a negative net result of 110,844 EUR), to retain a dissuasive but proportionate administrative fine.",

This incident in part involved user traffic to the British Airways website being diverted to a fraudulent site. Through this false site, customer details were harvested by the attackers. Personal data of approximately 500,000 customers were compromised in this incident, which is believed to have begun in June 2018. The ICO’s investigation has found that a variety of information was compromised by poor security arrangements at the company, including log in, payment card, and travel booking details as well name and address information.\n\nIn the meantime, the final fine imposed on the airline has been set at £20 million (approximately EUR 22,046,000). The ICO emphasized that when setting the amount of the fine, it also took into account the economic impact of the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic on the airline industry.",

A variety of personal data contained in approximately 339 million guest records globally were exposed by the incident, of which around 30 million related to residents of 31 countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). Seven million related to UK residents.\n\nIt is believed the vulnerability began when the systems of the Starwood hotels group were compromised in 2014. Marriott subsequently acquired Starwood in 2016, but the exposure of customer information was not discovered until 2018. The ICO’s investigation found that Marriott failed to undertake sufficient due diligence when it bought Starwood and should also have done more to secure its systems.\n\n--> Update: On 2020/10/30, the ICO announced its final decision to impose a fine of £ 18.4 million (approximately EUR 20.4 million) on Marriott International Inc. In its decision, the ICO set forth its considerations for the calculation of the fine, which included Marriott's absence of prior violations or omissions and the fact that Marriott had fully cooperated with the investigation and had taken steps to notify the individuals concerned. In addition, the ICO noted that it had also made an alignment with other fines already imposed on other companies - in particular also of other European data protection authorities.",

The fine was imposed against the school which had used facial recognition technology to monitor the attendance of students. Even though, in general, data processing for the purpose of monitoring attendance is possible doing so with facial recognition is disproportioned to the goal to monitor attendance.  The supervisory authority is of the opinion that biometric data of students was processed which is why Art. 9 GDPR is applicable. Additionally, the authority argued that consent can not be applied since students and their guardians cannot freely decide if they/their children want to be monitored for attendance purposes. When examining if the school board can rely on any of the exemptions listed in Art. 9 (2), the supervisory authority found that this was not the case.

According to the data protection authority, personal data of tenants were stored without checking whether storage was permissible or even necessary and it was therefore possible to access personal data of affected tenants which had been stored for years without this data still serving the purpose of its original collection. This involved data on the personal and financial circumstances of tenants, such as salary statements, self-disclosure forms, extracts from employment and training contracts, tax, social security and health insurance data as well as bank statements. In addition to sanctioning this structural violation, the Berlin data protection commissioner imposed further fines of between 6,000 and 17,000 euros on the company for the inadmissible storage of personal data of tenants in 15 specific individual cases. See the separate entry. *** UPDATE *** On 24 February 2021 the Berlin Regional Court has dismissed the fine against Deutsche Wohnen SE due to procedural errors, see <a class='blau' href='https://www.deutsche-wohnen.com/ueber-uns/presse-news/pressemitteilungen/landgericht-berlin-stellt-bussgeldverfahren-gegen-deutsche-wohnen-ein/' target='_blank'>link</a> and <a class='blau' href='https://www.heise.de/news/Gravierende-Maengel-Deutsche-Wohnen-wendet-DSGVO-Millionenstrafe-vorerst-ab-5064633.html' target='_blank'>link</a>",

A caller could obtain extensive information on personal customer data from the company's customer service department simply by entering a customer's name and date of birth. In this authentication procedure, the BfDI aws a violation of Article 32 GDPR, according to which a company is obliged to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to systematically protect the processing of personal data. Due to the company's cooperation with the data protection authority, the fine imposed was at the lower end of the scale. -- Update: On November 11th, 2020, after an appeal against the fine, the Bonn District Court decided that although the fine is justified in principle, it is unreasonably high. The chamber has therefore reduced the fine from originally EUR 9,55 million to EUR 900,000. One of the reasons for the reduction was that the company's procedure for authenticating customers used for its telephone hotline (requesting only the name and date of birth of the caller) had remained unobjected for a long time and therefore the company lacked a concrete awareness of the problem which leads to the fact that the concrete culpability in this case had to be classified as rather low. Furthermore, according to the court, the violation was also rather minor, as it could not lead to a massive data leakage.",

In addition, incorrect and non-transparent information on data processing was provided in Apps provided by the Company and invalid methods of consent were used. In some cases, paper forms requesting one single consent were used for various purposes, including marketing. Furthermore, data was kept longer than necessary and thus violated deletion periods. \n\nFor these violations, the telecommunications company received a fine of EUR 27.8 million. Among other things, the fine was imposed for: lack of consent for marketing activities (telemarketing and cold calling), addressing of data subjects who asked not to be contacted with marketing offers, invalid consents collected in TIM apps, lack of appropriate security measures to protect personal data (including incorrect exchange of blacklists with call centres), lack of clear data retention periods. The supervisory authority also imposed 20 corrective measures on TIM, prohibiting the use of personal data for marketing purposes from those who had refused to receive promotional calls from the call centres.",

Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten had already completed a review in 2017 of the way in which Google deals with the right of individuals to have search results removed from Google's search engine and that Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten had instructed Google to remove a number of search results. In addition, data inspections stated that it had initiated a further review of Google's practices in 2018 after it received indications that several of the results that should have been removed still appeared in search results. Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten also objected to Google's current practice of informing web site owners about which results Google is removing from search results, specifically which link has been removed and who is behind the request for removal from the list, as this is without legal basis.\n\nUpdate: On November 23th, 2020, after an appeal against the fine, the The Administrative Court of Stockholm announced that it had rejected Google LLC´s appeal.\nHowever the court reduced the fine from a total of SEK 75 million (approx. EUR  7 million) to SEK 52 million (approx. EUR 5 million).",

The bank insisted with the argument that the documentation is related to repaid loans and represents loan documentation that cannot be subject to the customers’ right of access. During the procedure initiated based on data subject’s complaints, the DPA ordered the bank to enable the right of access and provide copies of the requested loan documentation. When imposing the fine, the DPA took into consideration especially that the bank failed to comply with the ordered measures, that it continued with such practice for almost a year and denied the right of access to more than 2500 of its customers. The amount of the fine is now known at the moment, but as the DPA qualified the breach as “severe”, a high fine is expected.",

The employer argued that CCTV monitoring was necessary to assess, whether the employee fulfilled his employment related duties (i.e. monitoring certain public areas and signalling any unusual event to his colleagues) and that the monitoring also served the protection of its surveillance system from unlawful access or usage. NAIH found that monitoring of the employee by CCTV is not an appropriate way of assessing his work performance and the employer relied on an inappropriate legal basis (public interest, official authority) regarding the CCTV operations. The employer could have protected its public area surveillance system by other methods (e.g. by installing firewalls or other security upgrades to its systems). The employer also placed only a brief notice sheet at the entrance of the workstation of the employee regarding the CCTV monitoring, which NAIH deemed insufficient.",

The reasons for the fine were the rejection of an application by a data subject for dereferencing outdated articles that the data subject had considered to be damaging to its reputation, and lack of transparency in Google's form for dereferencing applications. The Belgian data protection authority found that articles relating to unfounded harassment complaints could have serious consequences for the data subjects, and natural persons were therefore entitled to have articles deleted/dereferenced. This also applies to persons who hold political office, even though these offices are generally less worthy of protection due to their public status and articles relating to political persons may therefore be stored for a longer period of time. Google's rejection of the application was therefore in breach of Article 17 of the GDPR (fine for this breach: €500,000). In addition, a further €100,000 was imposed for breach of the principle of transparency, as Google's rejection of the request for deletion was not sufficiently justified",

For example, the company conducted a 'Welcome Back Talk' after employees returned to work after vacation or illness. The information that became known in this context - including information on the symptoms of illness and diagnoses of the employees - was recorded and stored. In addition, according to the Hamburg data protection authority, some supervisors also used the 'Flurfunk' [meaning to hear something through the grapevine] to acquire a broad knowledge of individual employees, for example about family problems and religious beliefs. The information stored on the network drive was accessible to up to 50 managers of the company and was used, among other things, to evaluate the work performance of the employees and to make employment decisions.The data collection became known due to a technical configuration error in October 2019, according to which the data stored on the network drive was accessible company-wide for several hours. After the violation became known, the management apologized to the employees and offered monetary compensation. In addition, also further protective measures were introduced together with the data protection authority. [Note: Concrete legal basis of the fine not yet published - we assume this will mainly be Art. 5 and 6 GDPR]",

This investigation revealed several violations of the data protection law, including the violation of consent requirements and the violation of general data protection obligations such as accountability. One of the main criticisms made by the Data Protection Agency was the use of fake numbers to make promotional calls by the contracted call centers (i.e. phone numbers not registered with the National Consolidated Registry of Communication Operators). Furthermore, further violations could be found in the handling of contact lists purchased from external providers. Finally, security measures for the management of customer data were also considered inadequate.",

According to the Data Protection Agency, personal data such as names, full payment card numbers, Ticketmaster usernames and passwords, expiration dates and Card Verification Value (CVV) numbers were affected.

There, users have the option to set the visibility of their posts to private or public. Private posts can only be seen by subscribers of the respective user profile, while public posts are visible to the public. A programming bug in Twitter's Android app resulted in some private posts being visible to the public. The DPA found that Twitter had not properly fulfilled its reporting and documentation obligations. Twitter's legal team became aware of the error on January 2nd, 2019, and it was not until January 8th that the company informed the DPC. Consequently, the company failed to inform the DPC within the 72-hour period required by Art. 33 (1) GDPR. Furthermore, it had failed to adequately document the incident in accordance with Art. 33 (5) GDPR.",

The data subject then contacted the company and demanded, among others, information about which of his/her personal data had been processed. After this request was not properly fulfilled in a timely manner, the data subject filed a complaint against the controller \n\nDuring its investigations the DPA discovered that the controller  violated several GDPR provisions. Firstly the DPA found that the controller  failed to provide a proper privacy policy. The privacy policy on the controller´s website did not contain any information regarding the processing of personal data nor any contact information of the company. Secondly, the controller violated the data subject's right to information by failing to comply with the data subject's request for information on data processing. Lastly the controller infringed the principle of minimasation by processing the data subject's data for the purpose of sending a payment reminder only one day after the ticket had been issued even though the data subject had the opportunity to pay the fine without such a reminder at that time.",

Such a breach requires notification to the DPA and the individuals affected by the breach. In the letter, the supervisory authority advised the controller how to notify the breach and asked for explanations.\nDespite the letter requesting explanations, the controller did not report the data breach nor did it inform the data subjects about the incident.

Among others, the cameras covered workplaces, sales areas, warehouses and recreation areas. The company stated that the purpose of the installed video cameras was to prevent and investigate criminal acts and to track the movement of goods in the warehouses. However, to prevent theft, a company must first consider milder methods. Moreover, video surveillance to detect criminal acts is only permitted if there is a reasonable suspicion against specific persons. If this is the case, it may be permissible to monitor them with cameras for a limited period of time. At notebooksbilliger.de, however, the video surveillance was neither limited to a specific period nor to specific employees. In addition, the recordings were stored for 60 days in many cases, which was significantly longer than required. Customers of notebooksbilliger.de were also affected by the unlawful video surveillance, as some cameras were pointed at seating areas in the sales area. So far, the fine against notebooksbilliger.de is the highest fine that the LfD Niedersachen has issued under the GDPR.",

EUR 6,000,000 for violations of Art. 6 GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR and Art. 14 GDPR.         \nCustomers of the bank were supposed to accept new privacy policies allowing the controller to transfer the customers' personal data to all companies within the CaixaBank Group. At the same time, the data subjects were not given the option of specifically not consenting to this transfer. Instead, if they wished to disagree with the transfer of their data, they were required to send a letter of disagreement to each individual company in the group.\n\nThe DPA concluded that the bank had violated its information obligations as set out in Art. 13 GDPR and Art. 14 GDPR, as the information provided to customers under the privacy policy was not consistent, contained imprecise terminology, and did not provide sufficient information on the type of personal data processed and the nature of the processing.  Also, the information on the rights of the data subjects as well as the contact information of the controller were not provided in a consistent manner. \n\nFurthermore, the DPA notes that the controller had processed its customers' data beyond its legitimate interests, partly without a legal basis, and that the consent it obtained from customers did not meet the requirements of an effective consent. In addition, deficiencies in the company's procedures allowed it to obtain the consent of customers to process their personal data. The DPA further concludes that, as a result, the data was unlawfully transferred to the companies of the CaixaBank Group. This constitutes a violation of Art. 6 GDPR.",

Moreover, the processor has not foreseen or implemented adequate technical security measures following the incident to prevent or minimize the risks. One data subject was consequently exposed to insults and ridicule in the public and the security company has not taken any action to remove the recording from social networks and media. The amount of the fine is unknown at the moment, but the DPA clarified which aggravating circumstances it has taken into consideration when determining the fine – (i) the fact that the processor did not fulfil its obligation to inform the controller of the incident as required by the Art 33 (2) GDPR and (ii) the fact that the basic activity of the company is the provision of physical and technical protection, which includes the use of video surveillance. The DPA also noted that the fined security company is one of the leading companies in Croatia in that activity and as such should be the relevant entity in providing opinions, guidelines, advice and propose solutions to controllers on the use of the video surveillance system and give an example to its work and pay greater attention to it than others.",

The DPA received complaints from Waitum, S.L. and Servicios Aby 2018, S.L. because their customers had received letters from the controller. Both companies had previously transferred their customers' personal data to the controller under a network access agreement entered into with the controller. Under this agreement, the two companies acted as representatives of their respective customers, who were supplied with electricity by the controller. In the letters sent, the controller mentioned, among other things, alleged breaches of contract and non-payment by the companies to the controller. \nIn the course of its investigations, the DPA determined that the sending of these letters was neither related to nor necessary for the performance of the respective contract. The controller had therefore violated the principles of purpose limitation and data minimization, so that the sending of these letters constituted unlawful processing of the customers' personal data.",

The Italian National Institute for Social Security had been tasked with anti-fraud investigations related to COVID-19 relief funds. After press reports raised problems with the institute's data processing practices around the application review of politicians, the Italian DPA opened an investigation against INPS in August 2020. During that investigation, the DPA identified several violations. \n\nThe controller had collected data on tens of thousands of politicians from public sources and cross-checked it with data from applicants. In doing so, however, the controller had failed to ensure that data was collected only from those politicians who were eligible to receive the assistance funds. In doing so, the controller violated the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency as set out in the GDPR.\n\nFurthermore, the controller had violated the principle of data minimization by initiating checks on reimbursements even for individuals whose applications had been rejected and who had therefore never received payments.\n\nFurthermore, the controller had not adequately assessed the risks associated with a data processing operation as sensitive as that on applications for social benefits, since it had not carried out an impact assessment on the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. Update: Following an appeal presented by INPS the judge of the XVIII civil section of the Court of Rome annulled the fine of EUR 300,000.",

    "summary": "The Spanish DPA (AEPD) fined Equifax Iberica S.L. EUR 50,000 for a violation of Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR. The controller had added the data subject to a debtor register without informing her beforehand.  The data subject had outstanding payments of rent with her landlord, who had previously sent her corresponding requests for payment. The controller itself had also sent notices to the data subject requesting her to pay the debts. These, however, did not contain any information that the data subject would be entered in the debtors' register in the event of non-payment. \nAlso, the rental contract of the data subject did not contain any provisions in this regard, which led the DPA to conclude that the controller did not have a legitimate interest within the terms of the GDPR and thus had processed the personal data of the data subject without a legal basis.",

In response to a inquiry from the data subject as to where her new contact information came from, the controller informed her that its database was regularly updated using data obtained from the Spanish transport authority DGT (Dirección General de Tráfico). As the data subject had not given consent for such processing of her data, she filed a complaint against the controller with the Spanish DPA. An investigation by the DPA revealed that the company had indeed entered into a contract with DGT. However, DGT had clarified that the purpose of the processing of contact data under the contract was to ensure the accuracy of the address when renewing a driver's license or when issuing medical reports so that it could be sent to the correct address. Nevertheless, the data subjects must request and consequently consent to such a change of address. Since these criteria were not met in the specific case, the DPA found a violation of the purpose limitation principle.",

At two schools in Ålesund, teachers asked students to download the training app Strava for physical education classes. The students were then given tasks that the teachers controlled via the tracking function. According to the Norwegian DPA's investigation, this resulted in data breaches because the municipality failed to provide standard procedures for privacy-compliant app use in schools. For example, a data protection impact assessment was not carried out, although this would have been necessary in view of the potential risk to the students. In addition, adequate technical and organizational security measures had not been implemented to ensure the protection of the processing.",

The latter had installed a webcam on the roof of its office building in the center of Rognan which was in operation 24/7 and recorded the city center. These recordings could be viewed via a live video stream on Youtube and on the controller's homepage. In addition, the recordings could be rewound for up to twelve hours. \r\n\r\nThe area covered by the camera surveillance included a public street, the parking lot and entrance of two grocery stores, a pharmacy, a liquor store, the local bank, city hall, and a number of other buildings.\r\n\r\nIt was not possible to make out facial details or read license plates on cars due to the image quality and distance from the camera. Nevertheless, the image quality was good enough to be able to identify what type of car the data subjects were driving, what type of clothing they were wearing, what hair color they had, and other personal characteristics. This was sufficient for those watching the live broadcast to identify and track co-workers, colleagues, friends, family, or other acquaintances.\r\n\r\nThe Norwegian DPA concluded that the live broadcast constitutes a breach of Art. 6 (1) GDPR and Art. 5 (1) a) GPDR.\r\n\r\nThe decision highlights that the illegal camera surveillance involved a significant number of employees and that many were monitored repeatedly, some on a daily basis. Those who were monitored were on their way to and from work, who needed to buy groceries, medications, or alcohol, or who were in the public area for other reasons. These are activities where the data subjects do not expect to be monitored, and even less they expect the monitoring to be broadcast live on the Internet.",

Booking.com was notified of the data breach on January 13, 2019, but did not report it to the DPA until February 7, 2019.

Following a complaint from a former customer, claiming that the bank did not comply with his request to erasure of his data, the DPA started an investigation against the controller. The data subject had already been a customer of the bank in the past. At that time, he had exercised his right to erasure of his data. When he tried to open a new account with the controller, he was informed that this was not possible as his data was still blocked (due to his previous erasure request). The controller further informed the data subject that he would have to unblock the data if he wanted to open an account. For this purpose, a form was attached to the letter. The form stated that by signing it, the data subject was revoking his right to erasure and allowing his data to be used (again) by the controller. The DPA found that temporarily blocking the data, does not correspond to the right to erasure. The DPA also emphasized that deleted or blocked data may not be processed again when a new contractual relationship is entered into with the controller, even if the new processing purpose is the same as the previous one. The original fine of EUR 100,000 was reduced to EUR 60,000 euros due to the immediate payment and acknowledgement of guilt.",

The operator offers a range of diagnostic tests to patients. The results of the tests are subsequently communicated on its website to both patients and physicians who recommended the tests. The reported security breach involved an attack on the operator's website by an unknown individual. Following this incident, the operator stopped operating the website in question and proposed technical measures to increase security. However, the DPA still found that other websites operated by the same operator had the same shortcomings. Yet, the operator did not restrict their operation nor did it take any new technical measures. As a consequence, the UOOU imposed a fine of EUR 387.",

In 2017, the municipality decided to install special measurement boxes to measure crowds in the city center of Enschede. Sensors in the measurement boxes detected the wifi signals from the cell phones of passers-by and registered them with a code. Based on the registered codes, it was possible to calculate how busy the city center was. However, this also made it possible to track which measurement box a particular cell phone passed by, making it possible to track the movement of passers-by. The municipality states that it was never its intention to track passers-by. However, the DPA finds that the wifi tracking (even if it was unintentional) constitutes a serious breach of the GDPR. The DPA concludes that the municipality tracked its passers-by without an effective legal basis and thus violated Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR and Art. 6 (1) GDPR.",

This involved data subjects not being informed of their rights under Art. 15 GDPR - Art. 22 GDPR, and the contact details of the controller (e.g. its address) being incomplete.  Besides, the company's business practice allowed it to conclude contracts with customer representatives instead of with the customers directly. In these cases, however, the data controller did not check whether there was actually an authorization to represent the data subjects. The DPA finds that the controller failed to implement a procedure to verify the authorization of the alleged representatives.The fine is composed proportionately of EUR 1,000,000 for a breach of Art. 13 GDPR and EUR 500,000 for a breach of Art. 25 GDPR.",

Namely, the absence registration was accessible online, without any form of authentication. Yet, when an absence system is accessible via the Internet, the system is to be accessed only through a multi-factor authentication. In the DPA's view, another form of authentication would have been required in addition to the 'normal' login.",

As the DPA found, the controller had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure the protection of data processing. In addition, the controller did not comply with its information obligations pursuant to Art. 13 GDPR, as it had not properly informed the data subjects about the processing of their personal data at the time of the data collection.",

The fine was based on the fact that the controller installed a video surveillance system totaling 14 video cameras and monitoring the business premises. The controller states that the cameras were installed for the purpose of security of the premises. However, the cameras captured the employees' offices in a way that was not necessary for this purpose. For example, one camera also captured a considerable part of the employees' recreation room.

In addition, the controller had not properly informed the data subjects about the processing of the data by the video surveillance and thus violated its duty to inform.

Calls to the number 1177 from people living in the Stockholm, Sörmland and Värmland regions were put through by Inera to Medhelp AB, which took the calls. Medhelp had in turn contracted the Thai company Medicall Co Ltd. to take calls on weekends and at night. Both Medhelp and Medicall had a contract with the technology company Voice Integrate Nordic AB for, among other things, call recordings. A data breach had then occurred in which recordings of calls to the number 1177 were available on the Internet on a storage server belonging to Voice Integrate. \nThe incident resulted from the misconfiguration of a network-attached storage device that was publicly accessible over the Internet and did not use encrypted communications. A large number of calls were accessed due to the vulnerability. \n\nThe Swedish DPA found that MedHelp had failed to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure an adequate level of security to protect personal data so that unauthorized persons could not access it. Similarly, MedHelp had failed to properly inform callers about the processing of their personal data in accordance with Art. 13 GDPR. \n\nIn addition, the DPA finds the outsourcing of the processing of personal data to Medicall to be a breach of the legality principle set out in the GDPR. This is because Medicall is not covered by Swedish health and medical legislation and is therefore not subject to the legally regulated confidentiality obligation that exists in the Swedish healthcare sector.",

The video surveillance was taking place around the clock, although the controller itself stated that video surveillance was only required in case of emergency alarms.\r\nThe DPA concludes that the 24/7 monitoring was too far-reaching, but notes that the controller had weighty reasons for the camera surveillance. However, the camera surveillance should be limited to emergencie cases.

    "summary": "The Swedish DPA has fined Storstockholms Lokaltrafik (Stockholm Local Transport Company) EUR 1,600,000. \nThe controller had equipped ticket inspectors with body-worn cameras, which were designed to prevent threatening situations, document incidents, and ensure that the right person was fined for traveling on Stockholm's public transportation without a valid ticket.\nTicket inspectors were required to keep the camera on for their entire shift and were therefore able to film all passengers who passed the inspector. Since several hundred thousand people use public transportation in Stockholm every day, a large number of people were thus at risk of being monitored by video and audio recordings.\n\nThe DPA believes that body-worn camera technology could be used to prevent and document threatening situations, but that the pre-recording time should be reduced to a maximum of 15 seconds, as a longer pre-recording time is not necessary to achieve the above-mentioned purposes. Furthermore the DPA found that audio recordings did not contribute to the identification of persons without a valid ticket. The DPA therefore considered the audio recordings to be a violation of the principles of legality and transparency as well as data minimization. The DPA also criticized the controller for not providing sufficient information about the camera surveillance, including the fact that not only images but also sounds were recorded.",

In this regard the data of more than 16,000 customers who had not placed an order in the last five years had been retained. The same applied to more than 130,000 people who had not logged into their customer accounts for five years.\nIn addition, the controller violated its information obligations under Art. 13 GDPR. Furthermore, the controller failed to fulfill its obligation to fully comply with the deletion requests received. \nThe CNIL also found that the controller did not implement sufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure information security. Thus, for example, the controller did not require the use of a secure password during the process of opening an account the company´s website or when employees accessed the customer relationship management software. The fine is composed proportionately of EUR 300,000 for violations of Art. 5(1) e) GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR, Art. 17 GDPR and Art. 32 GDPR and EUR 200,000 for violations of Art. 82 Loi informatique et libertés and Art.

In its investigation against the cotroller, the DPA found that the cotroller had in fact processed personal data for telemarketing activities that it had not collected directly but had acquired from other sources. It had not checked whether valid consents had been obtained from the advertising addressees for all transfers of the data. The controller had received lists of personal data from one company, which in turn had acquired them from two other companies. The latter companies had obtained the consent of potential customers for the telemarketing carried out by them and by third parties, but this consent did not include the transfer of customer data to the controller. In this context, the DPA emphasized that consent given by a customer to a company for third-party promotional activities cannot extend its effectiveness to subsequent transfers to other operators.",

The system is used for services related to immunization programs in the municipality, as well as for other health checks and follow-ups of pregnant women. About 2000 people were potentially affected by the breach. Due to the data breach, errors had occurred in vaccine registration. As a result, the data subjects were at risk of receiving the wrong vaccines. There was also a potential for their immunization data to be misfiled in the national immunization registry.\nFurthermore, errors occurred in follow-ups for pregnant women, including information on the week of pregnancy or the mother's drug use. \nAlso, patient information was provided to health workers in a health service ward without being required and without access being documented.",

During their shifts, the controller's employees wore clothing provided by the controller.However, the designated changing room of the store was a storage room in which large quantities of cleaning materials were stored.  Due to a lack of sufficient space in this room, the employees (mostly minors) had to change in the general employee area, which was covered by a video camera. The controller stated that they had installed the video camera for security purposes. The DPA concluded that the controller had a legitimate interest in the video surveillance, but that the interests of the mostly underage employees must also be taken in account. The controller should have tried to implement less restrictive measures. In addition, the DPA underlined that the information on video surveillance was inadequate in both the employee and customer service areas. In determining the amount of the fine, the fact that a large number of the data subjects were minors was taken into account as an aggravating factor.",

For example, the systems processed drivers' data to an extent that exceeded the purpose of the processing and, in some cases, stored the data significantly longer than necessary. In addition, the controller had not taken sufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure secure data processing.

The data controller, a telecommunications company using the services of the IT provider, informed the DPA as well its users of the potential breach of personal data by the IT provider. The incident consisted of a security breach which led to unauthorized access and processing of personal data by hackers and involved personal data of 28,085 respondents. The incident occurred because the IT provider had not taken the necessary measures to achieve an adequate level of security in accordance with existing and foreseeable risks. The IT provider, as a data processor, was obliged to take appropriate technical security measures in such a way as to ensure the permanent confidentiality of the system, including regular testing, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure security of processing. When assessing the appropriate level of security, the IT provider should have taken particular account of the risks of unauthorized disclosure of personal data. Due to failure to take appropriate technical measures for the security of personal data processing, the DPA imposed an administrative fine on the IT provider. The amount of the fine is unknown at the moment. In its decision, the DPA took into account the nature of the IT provider’s business activity, whose role should be to support other entities through opinions and guidelines, proposing solutions for the implementation of web applications, and especially designing and implementing appropriate technical measures.",

    "summary": "The Italian DPA (Garante) has fined the municipality of Bolzano EUR 84,000. A former employee of the municipality filed a complaint with the DPA against the municipality. \r\nIn particular, the former employee complained that the municipality processed personal data related to his internet use during working hours and that he later received a notice of initiation of disciplinary proceedings accusing him of accessing Facebook for more than 40 minutes and YouTube for more than 3 hours during his working hours and of using the municipality's computer for private purposes.  The DPA's investigation revealed that the municipality had been using a system to control and filter employees' internet browsing for about a decade, with monthly retention of data and creation of special reports for network security purposes. The system also collected information that had nothing to do with professional activities and, in any case, concerned the private life of the person in question.\r\nThe DPA finds that the controller thus violated the principle of data minimization, lawfulness and purpose limitation. The controller should rather have taken less intrusive measures to prevent the private use of the Internet. The DPA pointed out that the need to reduce the risk of misuse of Internet navigation cannot lead to the complete elimination of any privacy of the data subject at the workplace, even in cases where the employee uses network services provided by the employer. In addition, the controller had not adequately informed employees about the collection of Internet history, in violation of its obligation under Article 13 of the GDPR. \r\nFurthermore, the investigation identified other violations in the processing of data related to employees' requests for extraordinary medical examinations, which were made using a special form. The form provided by the controller had to be checked by the head of the organizational unit, a circumstance that led to the unlawful processing of health data.",

In this regard, the DPA found a lack of diligence on the part of the controller in managing the personal data of its customers and thus a violation of Article 28 (3) GDPR. The fine is composed proportionally of EUR 2,000 for a breach of Art. 22(2) LSSI and 5,000 EIR for a breach of Art. 28(3) GDPR. However, the original fine of EUR 7,000 was reduced to EUR 4,200 due to the immediate payment and admission of guilt.",

At the same time, the CNIL received seven complaints from data subjects affected by this file.\n\nFor each of these individuals, the file contained information such as the organization they belonged to, the position they held, their business address, their business phone number, their cell phone number, their business email address, and in some cases their Twitter account. In addition, CNIL noted that each person was assigned a score from 1 to 5 to evaluate their influence, credibility, and support for Monsanto on various issues.\n\nThe DPA believes that the company violated the provisions of the GDPR by not informing the data subjects that their data was stored in this file. In addition, the CNIL complained that the company had not given the contractual guarantees that should normally regulate the relationship with a subcontractor. \n\nThe creation of contact files by stakeholders for lobbying purposes is not illegal in itself. However, CNIL stressed that data subjects nevertheless have the right to be informed of the existence of the file in order to exercise additional rights, in particular the right to object. \n\nIn addition, the CNIL found that the data collection was carried out by a provider contracted by Monsanto and that Monsanto violated Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation by not including in its contracts with the data processor the provisions foreseen in the GDPR, in particular regarding data security.",

The system captured everyone who entered the stores, including minors and MERCADONA employees.\nDuring its investigation, the DPA found numerous privacy violations. \n\nFor instance, the system violated the principle of data minimization, the principle of necessity and proportionality since the controller could process multiple biometric data - beyond the purpose of the system. \n\nIn addition, the DPA concluded that Mercadona's privacy impact assessment was deficient as it did not take into account the specific and unique risks to Mercadona's employees posed by data processing through facial recognition systems.\n\nFurthermore, MERCADONA had violated its duty to inform according by not properly providing data subjects with information about the processing of their personal data.\n\nThe original fine of EUR 3,150,000 consisted of EUR 500,000 due to a violation of Art. 5(1)(c), EUR 2,000,000 due to a violation of Art. 6 and Art. 9 of the GDPR, EUR 100,000 due to a violation of Art. 12 and Art. 13 of the GDPR, EUR 500,000 due to a violation of Art. 25(1) of the GDPR, and EUR 50,000 due to a violation of Art. 35 of the GDPR. The original fine was reduced to EUR 2,250,000 due to voluntary payment.",

However, the mere fact that time clocking is not possible in the application without processing the location data does not make it necessary to process them.\nThe DPA therefore considered this to be a violation of the lawfulness of the data collection and of the principle of data minimization, since the processing of location data was not necessary for the purpose of the processing - i.e., the mere recording of working hours.",

Garante's investigation revealed numerous and serious data protection violations.\nThe violations included a lack of transparency in the algorithms used to manage drivers, both when assigning jobs and when booking work shifts.\nDeliveroo had used a centralized system for driver management through which it then processed and managed the assignment of orders as well as the booking of work shifts.\nHowever, Garante notes that the controller did not adequately inform the drivers about the functioning of the system they had installed on their smartphones, and did not ensure the accuracy and correctness of the results of the algorithmic systems used to evaluate the drivers. \nIn addition, Garante found that Deliveroo carried out a meticulous control of the drivers' work performance - through the continuous geolocation of their device, which went far beyond what was necessary to assign the order (e.g., recording the position every 12 seconds) - and through the storage of a large amount of personal data collected during the execution of the orders, including communication with customer service. In this context, the storage period of the various data had not been defined in a manner appropriate to the purpose. Instead, the controller had defined a flat storage period of six years. Furthermore, the Garante found that the controller had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure adequate security of the processing. Deliveroo Italy had also not conducted a data protection impact assessment, although this would have been necessary due to the risk posed to the drivers.",

    "summary": "The Irish DPA (DPC) has imposed a fine of EUR 225,000,000 on WhatsApp Ireland Ltd. The DPA had started extensive investigations into the messaging service's compliance with transparency obligations back in December 2018. In this context, the DPC investigated whether WhatsApp complied with its obligations under the GDPR regarding the provision of information and the transparency of this information to users and non-users of WhatsApp. \n\nIn the course of the investigation, the DPC found that WhatsApp had committed serious violations of Art. 12 GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR and Art. 14 GDPR with respect to the information provided to users. \n\nFollowing the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to other affected European supervisory authorities in December 2020. The DPC subsequently received objections from eight supervisory authorities. Due to lack of agreement, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure pursuant to Art. 65 GDPR on June 3, 2021. \n\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPB), by its decision of July 28, 2021, then, required the DPC to reassess and increase its proposed fine based on a number of factors. The EDPS found a violation of the principle of transparency set forth in Article 5(1) a) of the GDPR in addition to the violations found by the DPC, and requested this to be reflected in the final amount of the fine. \n\nBased on this, the DPC imposed the fine in the amount of EUR 225,000,000. \n\nThe fine is composed as follows:\n\nEUR 90,000,000 for the violation of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR;\nEUR 30,000,000 for the violation of Art. 12 GDPR;\nEUR 30,000,000 for the violation of Art. 13 GDPR; and\nEUR 75,000,000 for the violation of Art. 14 GDPR.\n\n\nWith respect to Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 13 GDPR, the DPC found that WhatsApp had failed to provide information about the nature of the data collection 'in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.' This includes making the information easy for children to understand when it is addressed to them. For example, WhatsApp had distributed information about the relationship between WhatsApp and other Facebook companies and the sharing of data under that relationship through a variety of texts. Much of the information provided was of such general nature, moreover, that the DPC deemed it meaningless. Users often had to overcome multiple links to FAQs to get to the information they were looking for on WhatsApp's website. In this regard, the DPC stated that it would be unreasonable to expect users to search the WhatsApp website after failing to find sufficient information in the privacy statement itself.\n\nWith regard to Art. 14 GDPR, one of the issues was the impact of a user's consent allowing the messaging platform to have access to his or her contacts. As such, the company searched its users' contact information on their phones for phone numbers and other data, not only from other WhatsApp users, but also from contacts who do not even have a WhatsApp account. The DPC finds that this data had been processed unlawfully, as these contacts (especially those who do not have a WhatsApp account) had not received any information about this processing and therefore could not possibly have given their consent. \n\nGiven the seriousness and the far-reaching nature and impact of the breaches, the DPA concluded that there had also been a violation of the transparency principle from Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR.",

    "summary": "The Danish DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 53,800 on Midtjylland Region.\n\nOn June 12, 2020, the DPA received a notification from the region regarding a personal data security breach pursuant to Art. 33 GDPR. According to the notification, all patients and staff at a lifestyle center were able to access a building where up to 100,000 physical patient records were stored, including health information and personal identity number details. The reason for this was that both staff and patients had been given key cards that allowed them to access all three buildings of the lifestyle center, regardless of whether the user was required to access them. \nIn addition, passersby were able to take a look at the covers of some of the records -which showed personal data such as identity numbers and names - through a window in the building.\nIn this context, the DPA found that the Midtjylland Region had not taken adequate security measures for the storage of personal data.\n\nIn addition, the region had not established sufficient guidelines for access restrictions when creating key cards, and had not conducted adequate periodic testing, assessment, and evaluation of the security measures taken. \n\nIn evaluating the question of whether a fine should be imposed, the Danish DPA took into account, as an aggravating factor, that the region processed large amounts of sensitive data, such as health data.",

In another case, a customer received an advertising call on his cell phone number and informed Vodafone during the conversation that he did not want to receive any more advertising calls. Despite his request, Vodafone made twelve more marketing calls to his cell phone. In another case, the data subject filled out a form clearly stating his wish not to receive marketing calls from Vodafone. However, the employee who processed the request failed to register the customer's marketing preferences. As a result, the customer subsequently received fourteen more unsolicited commercial messages - seven emails and seven text messages.",

    "summary": "The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 800,000 on Roma Capitale. The Garante had launched an investigation following a complaint from an individual who had complained about the new parking meters installed in the city in 2018. In fact, the company Atac s.p.a., which was also contracted by the city to manage the parking lots, had initiated a technical upgrade of the parking meters in order to offer new services (e.g., the payment of fines/fees or the purchase/renewal of public transport tickets) and introduce new payment methods that also take into account the vehicle's license plate number. Part of the equipment was supplied by another company, Flowbird Italia s.r.l. All parking information was then managed through a centralized system, which could also be accessed through an app by the employees responsible for controlling parking fees.\n\nIrregularities were then identified during the investigation. Namely, the city of Rome, as data controller, had not provided information on the processing of the drivers' data, had not designated the company Atac as data processor, and had not provided it with the necessary instructions to process the data collected. Also, the subcontractor was not formally instructed nor instructed on how to proceed with the data processing.\n\nIt was also found that the companies had not established a data processing register. Also, the retention periods for the collected data were not specified, and appropriate security measures were not taken. For example, it was found that at the time of the audit, some data flows to and from the system implemented by Atac were going through insecure channels. In addition, officials could have checked any license plate en masse and repeatedly over time, for example, to find out a person's habits and parking location. \n\n\nIn calculating the fine for the unlawful data processing, the DPA aggravatingly took into account the large amount of personal data processed (from June 2018 to November 2019, the system established by Atac had already collected the data of 8,600,000 stops and potentially affects all users of the paid parking service in the city area) and the sanctions already received for data protection violations, but also the positive cooperation offered by the city and the companies to remedy some violations detected during the inspection.",

However, the screening tool was unable to scan the underlying data in PowerPoint presentations.\nIn this context, the DPA found that the region had not implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk. \nIn assessing whether a fine should be imposed, the DPA took into aggravating consideration the fact that Syddanmark Region processes large amounts of personal data, including health data - which is of a sensitive nature.",

This was intended to prevent 'bonus shopping', which is not lucrative for the companies. However, the controller had not properly informed the customers that such comparisons would be made.

    "summary": "The Norwegian DPA has fined Ferde AS, a Norwegian toll company, EUR 496,000.  \nThrough a report on the state-owned broadcasting company NRK, the Norwegian DPA became aware that Ferde AS was transferring information on passages in toll rings to a data processor in China. On this basis, the DPA initiated an investigation into whether Ferde has implemented routines and measures to ensure adequate information security for the information transferred to China.\n\nAs part of its operations, Ferde is responsible for registering passages at toll booths. The registration is usually done by a chip in the car. If the chip in the car is not properly registered or the car does not have a chip, a photo of the car's license plate is taken.\n\nThese images are then sent to an automatic optical character recognition system to digitally read the license plate. In cases where the image quality is not good enough for automatic interpretation, the image is transmitted for manual processing. Ferde contracted Unitel Bratseth Services (UBS), which also has employees in China, for this task. \n\nAfter its investigations, the DPA concluded that Ferde AS had violated a number of basic obligations of the GDPR for a period of 1-2 years. \n\nFor one thing, Ferde had not conducted a risk assessment before processing personal data and before using manual image processing by the processor. However, this would have been necessary to assess the risks associated with the transfer and to determine whether further security measures may be required. \n\nIn addition, the DPA found that Ferde had not entered into a proper processor contract regarding the processing of UBS.As a result, the transfer of the personal data in question to China took place without a valid legal basis. \nIn determining the amount of the fine, the DPA took into account the aggravating factor that a large amount of personal data was affected by the violation. On the other hand, the fact that no material or immaterial damage to the affected parties could be proven had a mitigating effect.",

    "summary": "The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 5,000 on the Ciechi Ardizzone Gioeni di Catania residential home for blind people. A visitor to the residence filed a complaint with the DPA. He based this on an installed video surveillance system in the accommodation. The video surveillance system recorded, among other things, the corridor connecting the accommodation with the communal showers. Moreover, the footage was not only recorded but also displayed in real time on the monitors of the concierge staff, creating the risk that the images could also be inadvertently seen by visitors or suppliers. During the course of the investigation, the institution's administration justified the installation of the video surveillance system by citing the need to prevent theft and ensure the health of residents by preventing unauthorized access during the pandemic period. \n\nThe DPA found that the institute thereby violated the principles of lawfulness, transparency and data minimization. The fact that, as claimed by the institute, the passage of the guests to the shower rooms was filmed only occasionally and for a short duration, and that the quality of the recordings was not 'perfectly clear,' does not resolve the unlawfulness of the recordings. Also, the DPA noted that some procedural precautions - such as scheduling time windows to turn off the cameras to allow guests to visit the shower rooms without being filmed, or temporarily ensuring the security of the locations through alternative measures, such as the use of security personnel - may allow the institute to pursue the purpose of the video surveillance in an equally effective manner and avoid unjustifiably restricting the freedoms of the data subjects.\n\nFurthermore, the DPA found that the institute had not properly fulfilled its duty to inform. The institute had only provided the data subjects with detailed information about the video surveillance system on the bulletin board after the investigation had begun. However, this type of information is not suitable for visually impaired people. The institute should have provided the residents with a pre-recorded audio message that could be played back if necessary.",

    "summary": "The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 200,000 on Bocconi University. A student had filed a complaint with the DPA about possible GDPR violations related to the use of a monitoring system during written exams. In the context of the emergency situation triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, the university had equipped itself with the remote monitoring software Respondus provided by the American company Respondus Inc. to ensure the normal running of the exams, since it was not possible to take the exams live and in person as usual. The software was able to monitor the behavior of the students through video recordings and snapshots taken at random intervals. In addition, the exam was audio-visually recorded and a photograph was taken of each examinee at the beginning of the exam. At the end of the exam, the system processed the video, inserted warning signals regarding possible indications of incorrect behavior, and, among other things, assigned a so-called 'review priority' so that the examiner could subsequently assess whether an unauthorized act had been committed during the exam. In its investigation the DPA found that students were not properly informed of the processing of their personal data involved in the use of Respondus. For instance they were not informed that they would be audiovisually recorded and that the images would subsequently be processed. In addition, students were not provided with information regarding specific retention periods for personal data. Nor had they received sufficient information about the fact that their personal data would be transferred to the United States; instead, they were only informed in general terms that personal data would be processed both within and outside the territory of the European Union. Furthermore, the DPA found that the little information the students had received was presented in a fragmented and disorganized manner in various documents. The DPA considered this to be a violation of the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency. The DPA also found that the university had processed the personal data without a valid legal basis. Thus, consent to the processing of personal data was a prerequisite to participate in the exams in the first place. As an alternative to online exams, the option of an in-person exam was proposed. However, in the light of the  pandemic, this also meant an increased health risk. Students were also concerned that refusing to take the online exams would negatively impact their grades. Consequently, the DPA concluded that the students' consent could not be considered voluntary. Further, the DPA found that the university retained the data for 12 months, although this would not have been necessary for the purpose of ensuring that the exams were properly carried out. \nEventually, the DPA found violations related to the transfer of data to Respondus. The processing agreement between the University and Respondus was based on the data protection agreement between the EU and the USA, known as the Privacy Shield, although it had been declared invalid by the Schrems II ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). For this reason, the DPA found that the university transferred personal data to a third country, even though this transfer was not in compliance with the conditions set forth in Chapter V of the GDPR.",

    "summary": "The Italian DPA (Garante) has fined Sky Italia S.r.l. EUR 3,296,326 for illegal telemarketing. \nThe DPA's decision followed a complex investigation launched after dozens of reports and complaints from people who claimed that they received unsolicited promotional calls and promotional SMS both from Sky Italia directly and through call centers of other companies. \nIn this regard, the DPA found that the promotional calls were made without adequately informing the users (such as about the origin of the personal data transmitted to Sky Italia). Thus, data subjects would have had the opportunity to contact the company that collected the data and object to the processing.  Only after obtaining consent, Sky would then have been allowed to proceed with the commercial offers. \nSky used lists of data it had acquired from other companies for these promotional purposes. Contrary to Sky Italia's view, the consent to the disclosure of data to third parties given by the data subjects to the companies from which Sky Italia had acquired the lists did not authorize Sky Italia to use the data for its own promotional purposes.\nIn addition, Sky failed to verify the list of individuals who had objected to being contacted for advertising purposes before making the advertising calls. As a result, several data subjects had received advertising calls despite their explicit objection. Further, the DPA found that Sky had failed to properly appoint the suppliers of the lists as data processors. \nIn determining the amount of the fine, the DPA took into aggravating consideration that the violations involved 'systemic' conduct that was rooted in the company's operations as well as the fact that Sky should have acquired sufficient experience and competence to make fundamental decisions in compliance with data protection regulations due to its ongoing contacts with the authority and its long-standing presence in the market.",

However, the controller had not adequately informed the data subjects about the data processing, including profiling. For example, the controller had only provided data subjects with general information about the various profiling processing operations, so data subjects could not know exactly what the processing they had consented to consisted of.",

This could have potentially allowed the hacker to access data such as names, dates of birth, gender, email addresses, phone numbers, flight information and booking numbers of 25 million passengers. It was found that the hacker actually downloaded the personal data of 83,000 people. In 367 cases, the data included medical information of people who had requested, for example, wheelchair transportation or additional services because they were blind or deaf. The DPA noted that a lack of security measures allowed the hacker to access the systems. Thus, it was possible to access the airline's systems simply by entering the password. The systems did not incorporate multi-factor authentication. Furthermore, the access rights of the accounts were not limited to necessary systems, allowing the hacker to use them to gain access to multiple Transavia systems. The DPA found that Transavia had breached its duty to implement technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk to data subjects.",

    "summary": "The French DPA (CNIL) imposed a fine of EUR 400,000 on RATP (the operator of the public transport system in Paris). In May 2020, a trade union filed a complaint with the CNIL alleging that the number of strike days exercised by staff were included in files used to prepare promotion decisions. The CNIL then conducted investigations in several RATP bus centers. These led to confirmation of this practice in three RATP bus centers. The CNIL indicated that files for evaluating performance and promotion prospects should only contain data necessary for evaluating employees.In particular, it was sufficient to indicate the total number of days of absence without the need to go into detail and distinguish the days associated with the exercise of the right to strike. It found that the use of data on the number of days staff members were on strike was not necessary for these purposes, and that the RATP thus violated the principle of data minimization set forth in Article 5 (1) (c) GDPR. In addition, the DPA found that the RATP had excessively retained many of its employees' data. Indeed, the RATP kept files on the evaluation of staff members for more than three years after the promotion commission, although their retention was only required for 18 months after the holding of these commissions. Further, CNIL found that RATP did not adequately differentiate between staff authorization levels, allowing more staff than necessary to access certain data. For this reason, CNIL concluded that RATP failed in its duty to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.",

The DPA conducted the investigation on its own initiative after information about a possible personal data breach (Art. 33 GDPR) of the company's customers became public in February 2021. According to the company, they learned about the security breach from another cybersecurity service provider who informed them that the customer data of 110,302 CityBee users had been published on the website of the hacking forum RaidForums.com. This included data such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, personal identification numbers, driver's license numbers, type of payment card and the last four digits of the card number of the data subjects. \n\nThe DPA's investigation revealed that the published data originated from an unsecured backup copy of a database. \n\nThe DPA found that the data breach occurred due to the company's failure to comply with its obligation to implement technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk to data subjects. \n\nThe company had, for example, failed to appoint a person with appropriate competence to be responsible for security and risk management.

However, even for these purposes, the processing would not have been necessary. \n\nFor this reason, the tax and customs administration should have deleted the data on dual nationality as early as January 2014. Nevertheless, as of May 2018, the dual citizenship data of a total of 1,4 million people were still registered in the systems of the tax and customs administration.\n\nThe DPA therefore found that the data had been unlawfully processed due to the lack of a valid legal basis. Furthermore the DPA stated that the data subjects had been discriminated against on the basis of their nationality.",

    "summary": "The Norwegian DPA has fined Grindr LLC EUR 6.3 million. Grindr is a location-based social networking app designed for gay, bi, trans and queer people.  In 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Protection Authority filed a complaint against Grindr with the Norwegian DPA, alleging that the portal had shared information about users' GPS location, IP address, cell phone advertising ID, age and gender with several third parties for marketing purposes. \n\nUnder GDPR, consent is required for the sharing of this personal data. However, during its investigation, the DPA found that the consent collected by Grindr was not valid. \n\nUsers had to accept the privacy policy in order to use the app, but were not explicitly asked whether they would consent to their data being shared with third parties for marketing purposes. In addition, the information about the disclosure of personal data was not clear or accessible enough for users. \n\n\nThe DPA points out that this type of data may identify a Grindr user as a member of a sexual minority. Grindr users would sometimes want to use the app anonymously without, for example, giving their full name or uploading a photo of themselves. With the sexual orientation of the users, a special category of personal data, which is subject to a particularly high level of protection, was therefore also affected. \n\nThe DPA therefore considers the infringement to be a particularly serious case that justifies a deterrent high fine. Business models based on behavior-based marketing are widespread in the digital economy, making it important that the fines for GDPR violations are deterrent.",

    "summary": "The Finnish DPA has fined Vastaamo psychotherapy center EUR 608,000. In September 2020, the psychotherapy center reported an attack on its patient database to the DPA. An unauthorized third party had gained access to Vastaamo's medical database on at least two occasions, in December 2018 and March 2019. The attacker had also siphoned off data and left a ransom note on the servers. Due to insufficient logging, neither the exact date of the breach nor the network addresses used by the attacker could be identified.\n\nThe most likely cause of the medical database leak was an unprotected port on the database where the root user account of the database was not password protected. The patient database server was open to the Internet without firewall protection during the period between November 26, 2017, and March 13, 2019.\n\nFor this reason, the DPA determined that the personal data were not adequately protected against unauthorized and unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction, or damage, and that the controller had not implemented basic measures for the secure processing of personal data.\n\nAs part of its investigation, the DPA also determined that the controller must have known as early as March 2019 that data in the patient information system had been lost and could have been compromised by an external attacker. Vastaamo should have immediately reported the security breach to both the DPA and its patients. However, Vastaamo was significantly late in meeting this obligation. \n\nThe fine is composed proportionately of EUR 145, 600 for the breach of Art. 33 (1) GDPR, EUR 145, 600 for the breach of Art. 34 (1) GDPR and EUR 316, 800 for the breach of Art. 5 (1) f) GDPR.",

The notices contained, among other things, sensitive data of the demonstrators and organizers of the demonstrations. The data revealed, among other things, the political opinion , religious or philosophical beliefs or sexual orientation of the data subjects. The DPA found that the transfer of the data would not have been necessary for the entities to properly perform their public tasks. Thus, the processing took place without a sufficient legal basis. In addition, the DPA found that the municipality had carried out the processing without informing the data subjects, without establishing a policy for the retention of their personal data, and without conducting a data protection impact assessment.",

Following a complex preliminary investigation launched after hundreds of reports and complaints from users, the DPA finds that the controller illegally processed the personal data of millions of users for telemarketing purposes. The DPA found, among other things, that data subjects received unsolicited promotional calls in the name of and on behalf of Enel Energia, in some cases even recorded calls. Some of the data subjects still received advertising calls, even though they had already requested Enel Energia to delete their personal data several times or had objected to their processing for advertising purposes. In particular, the DPA found that Enel Energia had not provided data subjects with the required and timely feedback on their requests to exercise their rights of access and opposition. In addition, the DPA found that the company had not sufficiently cooperated with the DPA during the investigation. For example, Enel Energia failed to respond to various inquiries from the DPA. In assessing the fine, the DPA considered the following factors aggravating: the seriousness of the violations, the duration and repetition of the violations, as well as the large number of persons affected and the negligence of the conduct. Update: The Court of Rome overturned the fine of EUR 26.5 million.",

As part of an investigation, the DPA conducted an audit of the processing of personal data by the council or on its behalf using video surveillance systems, automatic license plate recognition, body-worn cameras and other technologies that can be used to monitor individuals. In doing so, it found that the Council had violated a number of data protection laws in its use of the technologies. However, the fine was issued due to GDPR violations. \n\nThe DPA found that the Council violated Art. 13 GDPR in relation to the processing of data by traffic cameras. The Council had failed to provide information on the identity of the data controller, the contact details of the data protection officer, the purposes of the processing and the bodies from which further information required under Art. 13 GDPR may be obtained.  In addition, the Council failed to provide this information in an easily accessible manner such as on signs near the cameras.\n\nFurther, the DPA concluded that the Council failed to post a video surveillance policy in an clear and plain language as well as in an easily accessible area of the Council's website. The DPA thus found an infringement of Art. 12 GDPR. \n\nLastly, the Council has denied requests for access to personal data processed by surveillance cameras used in traffic management. For this reason, the DPA found that the Council violated Art. 15 GDPR.",

The stolen data included sensitive information, from Cosmote subscribers such as age, gender and contract information. Nearly 10 million people were affected by the incident. \n\nFor this reason, the DPA found that Cosmote had failed to implement adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure the proper execution of the data anonymization process.  In addition, Cosmote did not conduct a sufficient data protection impact assessment and did not properly inform data subjects about the processing of their data. \n\nFinally, the DPA found that Cosmote did not clearly regulate the allocation of roles in data processing with its subsidiary, OTE Group. \n\nIn calculating the fine, the DPA aggravatingly took into account the very long duration of the breaches (6 years), the large number of data subjects, as well as the fact that no pseudonymization measures of the data were implemented over a long period of time.",

    "summary": "The DPA from Hamburg has issued a fine against a company that operates an online marketplace, especially for worn underwear. The company advertises that it guarantees one hundred percent anonymity. On the platform, users can upload photos of underwear. In most cases, smartphones or other mobile devices were used to take the photos. The camera apps of the smartphones or GPS modules of the cameras often store additional information in the image file alongside the actual image as a standard setting. Based on this data, a fairly precise localization is possible. A review by the DPA revealed that the company had not cleaned up the residual information or metadata in the uploaded photos. Consequently, the data could be entered into any map service and the exact location where the photo was taken could be determined. The number of data subjects involved was approximately around 760 women between the ages of 18 and 50. For this reason, the DPA found that the company had failed to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk posed to the data subjects. In addition, the DPA concluded that the company had unlawfully processed the associated data by uploading the photos without cleaning them.",

Some time later, he registered for a course at another company of the same parent company and was rejected there. As a reason, he was told that he still had arrears with the company whose courses he had already attended. Following a complaint filed by the individual against the company, the DPA launched an investigation. It found that those companies shared a common database. It pointed out that the maintenance of a common customer database by several, legally independent companies, leads to joint responsibility according to Art. 26 GDPR. According to Art. 26 (2) GDPR, this requires an agreement that reflects the respective actual functions and relationships of the jointly responsible parties towards data subjects. However, such an agreement did not exist.",

    "violation": "Insufficient legal basis for data processing",
    "summary": "The Belgian DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 250,000 on IAB Europe. The DPA had received several complaints against IAB Europe since 2019. In the context of this complaint, the compliance of the 'Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF)' with the GDPR was mainly questioned. The TCF was developed by IAB to promote compliance with the GDPR by organizations using the OpenRTB protocol. \n\nThe OpenRTB protocol is a protocol for 'real-time bidding,' which is the automated online auction of user profiles for the sale and purchase of advertising space on the Internet. When users visit a website that contains an ad space, technology companies, through an automated auction system, can bid in real time for that ad space to display personalized advertising. \n\nWhen users visit a website for the first time, an interface appears through which they can consent to the collection and sharing of their personal information or object to various types of processing. \n\nAs part of the TCF, a consent management tool appears during this process. The tool allows the user to object to certain types of data processing. The TCF registers the user's preferences through the tool by generating a TC string and sends it to all partners participating in the OpenRTB system. Based on this TC string, user profiles are compiled, which are then passed on to advertisers. This makes it visible to them what kind of data processing the users have agreed to. \n\nWithin the scope of its investigation against IAB, the DPA identified a number of violations of the GDPR.\n\nIt found that the TC strings already constituted personal data and therefore IAB was required to have a legal basis for processing these data. However, IAB was unable to demonstrate any such legal basis.\n\nIn addition, IAB did not properly inform users about the functioning of the TCF. For example, the information provided to users was too generic and vague to understand the scope of the data processing. \n\nFurthermore, IAB had not maintained a register of its processing activities, had not appointed a data protection officer, as well as had not conducted a data protection impact assessment.",

The data subject is a customer who filed a consumer complaint relating to inaccurate measuring and consequently charging of fuelled petrol at one of the petrol stations. The data subject requested a copy of its personal data, i.e. a copy of the video surveillance footage relating to a specific time and area. The energy company justified rejecting the request by: (i) lack of written request by competent authorities to deliver the footage, (ii) lack of justified purpose for the request, and (iii) claiming that providing a copy of the footage would adversely affect rights and freedoms of the station’s personnel and other customers. Following issuance of the DPA’s general opinion to the customer on the obligation of the controllers to provide surveillance footage to the data subjects filmed on such footage, the energy company informed the customer on the inability to provide the footage as the video surveillance footage archives are being erased after seven days. Due to the violation of fundamental rights of the data subject the DPA imposed a fine of HRK 940,000.00. The clarification on the fine amount notes that the DPA has taken into consideration not only the indirect damages to the customer, but also the potential financial gains of the company that has indirectly avoided damages that could have arisen in the course of a consumer dispute and the fact that by deleting the footage, the company has eliminated potentially important evidence.",

The recording was made public by leaking to social media and consequently other media outlets. The DPA determined that the data controller did not take adequate actions to prevent its employees from creating the footage. Although the company did undertake certain measures such as adopting internal acts on access to video surveillance footage, educating employees and implementing confidentiality statements, the DPA determined the company did not ensure – neither before nor after the disclosure of the unauthorised footage – appropriate organisational and technical security measures for the purpose of minimising risk of such or similar data breaches. In addition, the data controller did not regularly monitor or inspect efficiency of the technical and organisational measures implemented for the purpose of maintaining confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of personal data.

In the course of its investigation, the DPC found that Meta failed to demonstrate that it had taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data of EU users. \n\nThe fine proceedings involved cross-border data processing, which is why the decision was subject to the co-decision procedure under Art. 60 GDPR involving all other European supervisory authorities as co-decision-makers.  Although two European DPAs objected to the DPC's draft decision, a consensus was ultimately reached. Accordingly, the DPC's decision reflects the collective views of the DPC and the other European DPAs.",

    "summary": "The Dutch DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 3,7 million on the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration. This is the highest fine ever imposed by the Dutch DPA\n\nAs part of its investigation, the DPA found a number of violations of the GDPR. \n\nThe Tax and Customs Administration had kept a list for several years on which it recorded indications of fraud. The list contained information on over 270,000 individuals, including minors. The administration had processed personal data such as health, citizenship, and criminal personal data as part of the list maintenance.\n\nThe DPA initially found that the administration did not have a valid legal basis for processing the data contained in the list. For this reason, the data were processed unlawfully. \n\nFurther, the DPA found that the information in the list was often incorrect, so that a large number of individuals were falsely registered as possible fraudsters. \n\nIn addition, the investigation revealed that the maintenance of the list led to discrimination against some individuals, as the risk of fraud was determined on the basis of the nationality and appearance of the data subjects, among other factors. For example, donations to mosques were considered a risk factor for fraud. \n\nFurthermore, the DPA found that the administration violated its obligation under the GDPR to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures that ensure adequate protection of the personal data it collects. Indeed, the administration had inadequately secured the personal data. \n\nThe DPA also found that the administration had violated the principle of storage limitation by storing the data for a longer time contrary to the retention period established for the personal data in the list.\n\nFurthermore, the DPA found that the processing of the data in the list had not been necessary for the administration to properly perform its tasks. The processing was therefore disproportionate. Also, the administration had not sufficiently defined the purposes underlying the processing and thus violated the principle of purpose limitation. \n\nThe fine is composed as follows: \n\nEUR 1 million for a breach of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR and Art. 6 (1) GDPR;\nEUR 750,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) b) GDPR;\nEUR 750,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) d) GDPR;\nEUR 250,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) e) GDPR;\nEUR 500,000 for a breach of Art. 32 (1) GDPR\nEUR 450,000 for a breach of Art. 35 (2) GDPR.",

This constitutes a violation of Art. 32 GDPR.\n\nFor example, no specific procedure for data migration operations had been implemented. Also, the leaked data had not been stored in encrypted form on the server. In addition, the DPA found that DEDALUS lacked authentication for access to the public area of the server. \n\nThe absence of such security measures was one of the main causes of the data leak. \n\nFurther, the DPA found that the contractual documents between DEDALUS and its customers did not comply with the requirements set forth in Art. 28 GDPR.\n\nThe DPA took into aggravating consideration the seriousness of the violations committed, in particular the security breaches, as well as the large number of individuals affected, when imposing the fine.",

    "summary": "The Icelandic DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 36,000 on the City of Reykjavík. The city had used the digital education system 'Seesaw' at several schools. The student system processed, among other things, personal data of minor students such as teacher feedback and information about students' private affairs. \nDuring its investigation, the DPA found that the purpose of the processing of the children's data had not been sufficiently clearly defined. In this context, the DPA also found a breach of the principle of proportionality and data minimization. In addition, the DPA concluded that the city had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures regarding the protection of personal data. This would have been necessary given the high risk that the data might be transferred to and processed in the United States. \nIn determining the fine, mitigating consideration was given to the fact that no damage was caused by the data breaches.",

    "summary": "The Spanish DPA (AEPD) has imposed a fine of EUR 10 million on GOOGLE LLC. Two data subjects had complained to the DPA that Google had disclosed their personal data to third parties without authorization. \n\nIn the course of the lengthy investigation, the DPA found that Google had passed on personal data of data subjects to the so-called Lumen project. \n\nLumen is a project run by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. The project began in 2002 for the purpose of collecting requests relating to the removal of content from websites within and outside of the United States. This data may then be accessed by researchers and other interested parties. \n\nUsers of Google-operated platforms such as YouTube or Google Drive have the option of requesting that content about themselves on the platforms be removed. For this purpose, Google has provided various contact and complaint forms.\n\nHowever, the data of the data subjects who use these forms was automatically transmitted to the Lumen project. \nThe data subjects did not have the opportunity to object to this transmission, because the automatic transmission to Lumen was a condition for using the forms. \nFor this reason, the DPA found that, due to the lack of possibility to object to the transfer of the data to Lumen, Google processed the data subjects' data without a valid legal basis. \n\nIn this context, the DPA also found that Google did not sufficiently enable data subjects to exercise their right to erasure of their data. \n\nWhen assessing the fine, the DPA took into account as aggravating factors that the data was not only disclosed, but also transferred to a third country without giving the data subjects the possibility to object to it. This deprived the data subjects of control over the handling of their personal data. In addition, the DPA found that the transfer took place over a very long period of time. \nAlso, a large number of individuals were affected and in some cases sensitive data was processed.",

The company holds a database of more than 20 billion facial images (including those of UK residents and nationals) from around the world. The data is collected online from publicly accessible platforms such as social networks. The company offers a search service that allows individuals be identified based on the biometric data extracted from the images. Individuals' profiles can be enriched with information associated with those images, such as image tags and geolocation. Clearview AI no longer offers its services in the UK, but it does in other countries, which means that the company continues to use personal data of UK residents. \n\nIn the course of its investigation the DPA found that the personal data contained in the company's database had been processed unlawfully and without a valid legal basis. \n\nFurthermore, in order to exercise their rights under the GDPR, such as the right of access under Art. 15 GDPR, data subjects had to provide Clearview with additional personal data by submitting a photograph of themselves that could be matched against the Clearview database. According to the DPA, this constitutes a significant impediment and deterrent to the exercise of such rights.\n\nIn addition, the DPA found that the company had violated several principles of the GDPR. For example, the company had violated the principle of transparency by failing to adequately inform users about the processing of their data. Clearview had also violated violated the principle of storage limitation by not providing a data retention policy and thus not being able to ensure that personal data is not held for longer than necessary. Further, Clearview failed to conduct a privacy impact assessment despite the high risk to data subjects' data.",

For two years, he published the first and last names, the residential addresses of the client and his family members, as well as various unredacted parts of files on his blog - and invoked the press privilege. However, this was not a purely exclusive journalistic publication. Rather, the attorney was concerned with accelerating the payment of the monetary amount to which he believed he was entitled. Since the attorney could therefore not refer to the press privilege as the legal basis for the data processing, the DPA found that he had unlawfully processed the data of the data subjects.",

For this, two emails were inadvertently sent with an open distribution list (one to 912 recipients and the second to 869 recipients).\n\nIt was clear from the content of the email that all recipients were patients of the clinic. The trust immediately recognized the error and unsuccessfully attempted to recall the emails. \n\nAs part of its investigation, the IOC determined that the trust had no technical or organizational measures in place to prevent or mitigate this highly predictable human error. The ICO rated the harm to affected individuals as high given that information about the affected individuals' relationship with a gender identity clinic is very sensitive personal information. \n\n\nDue to immediate implementation of security measures and extensive cooperation with the ICO, the fine was reduced from EUR 910,000 to EUR 91,00.",

    "summary": "The Finnish DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 85,000 on Otavamedia Oy. \n\nThe DPA had received eleven complaints regarding Otavamedia between 2018 and 2021. Namely, the complaints primarily concerned the lack of response to inquiries from data subjects.  \n\nOtavamedia explained that some of the privacy requests had not been fulfilled due to a technical problem with email management. During the incident, messages received in the privacy inquiry email box were not forwarded to customer service representatives. The situation had only been discovered after seven months. \n\nIn this context, the DPA noted that Otovamia should have tested the new e-mail system before using it in order to be able to guarantee the response to the requests and the rights of the data subjects. \n\nAnalogous request were possible, but the request form had to be signed by the data subjects for identification purposes. However, Otavamedia was not processing the signature data in any other contexts, so the signature could not even be cross-checked. \nThe DPA concluded that Otavamedia thereby collected an unnecessarily large amount of data for identification purposes and made the exercise of data subject rights harder by requiring signatures.",

Individuals' profiles can be enriched with information associated with those images, such as image tags and geolocation. In the course of its investigation the DPA found that the personal data contained in the company's database had been processed unlawfully and without a valid legal basis. Also, the DPA found that the company had not provided the data subject with access to their personal data and thus violating Art. 15 GDPR. Furthermore, Cleaview had violated the principle of transparency by failing to adequately inform users about the processing of their data.",

In addition, personal data of users who had been inactive for more than eight years were still stored in the company's databases.\n\nThe CNIL found that this long retention constituted a violation of Art. 5 (1) e) GDPR. \n\nFinally, the DPA found that users were not adequately informed during the registration process on the company portal, and that the company thus violated Art. 12 GDPR.",

In addition, the CNIL found that due to technical problems, many individuals were unable to opt-out of receiving the promotional emails. \r\n\r\nIn this context, CNIL found that ACCOR had not sufficiently informed data subjects about the processing of their personal data in the context of promotional messages and thus violated Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 13 GDPR. \r\n\r\nFurther, ACCOR had failed to respond to data subjects' requests for access to personal data in a timely manner, and thus the CNIL found a violation of Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 15 GDPR. \r\n\r\nThe company had also failed to comply with the data subjects' right to object due to the technical problems. The CNIL therefore found a violation of Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 21 GDPR. \r\n\r\nFinally, the CNIL found a violation of Art. 32 GDPR because ACCOR allowed the use of passwords that were not sufficiently secure. \r\n\r\nIn imposing the fine, CNIL considered aggravatingly that the violations affected several fundamental principles of personal data protection and constituted a fundamental infringement of the rights of the data subjects, as well as the number of data subjects involved.",

The initial draft proposed a fine of EUR 30-50 million. The DPC subsequently received objections from six supervisory authorities, which led to a dispute resolution procedure at the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) in Brussels. In its decision, the EDPB requested the DPC to increase the proposed fine.\n\nThe DPC's investigation revealed that on Instagram business accounts of minors, their cell phone numbers and email addresses were publicly displayed. In addition, the settings for the underage users' accounts were set to 'public' by default , making their social media content publicly viewable unless they changed the account settings. The breach potentially affects millions of teenagers.",

    "summary": "The UK DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 1,547,000 on Easylife Ltd. Easylife is a retailer that sells household items as well as services and products under its health, motor, supercard and garden clubs.\n\nWhen purchasing certain products, the company made assumptions about the customer's health condition, whereupon the customer was then offered further products for purchase by phone or SMS that were related to their health condition. \n\nOf the 122 products in Easylife's Health Club catalog, 80 items were classified as 'trigger products.' Once customers purchased these products, Easlylife created a profile of them in order to target them with a health-related item. \n\nDuring its investigation, the DPA found that the company collected and used the personal data (health data) of a total of 145,500 data subjects without their consent or even knowledge. \n\nThe DPA found that this 'invisible' processing of the personal data constituted a serious violation of the data subjects' rights, as they were not able to exercise their privacy and data protection rights at all due to lack of knowledge of the processing. \n\nIn addition, the company had made 1,345,732 unsolicited marketing calls to individuals without their consent to the calls. The DPA considered this a violation of the PECR.",

The controller had notified the DPA of a data breach pursuant to Art. 33 GDPR. \nInterserve had suffered a cyber attack in which the attackers sent a phishing mail to the mailbox of Interserve's accounting team. The mail was opened by an employee who also downloaded and opened an attached zip file. This allowed the attackers to install malware and siphon off personal data from 113,000 employees. The siphoned data contained bank account information, social security numbers, ethnicity, sexual orientation and religion of the data subjects, among other things. \n\nThe DPA's investigation found that inadequate security measures allowed the attack to occur. \n\nInterservere employees, for example, had not been adequately trained on data privacy. \n\nIn addition, Interserve processed personal data on unsupported operating systems that were no longer subject to security updates to address vulnerabilities in the system. Also, Interserve had not conducted adequate vulnerability scans. Finally, Interserve's information security team had not sufficiently investigated the attack as antivirus software reported that the malware had been removed.",

Firstly, the DPA found that, contrary to the specified information in the privacy policy, Techpump shared users' personal data with companies belonging to the same group. In addition, the DPA found that Techpump had not specified a retention period for users' personal data and kept it indefinitely until users requested to withdraw their consent. Techpump also processed users' personal data without first obtaining their consent. Further, the DPA found that Techpump did not have sufficient parental controls to prevent minors under the age of 14 from accessing its content. In addition, Techpump's privacy policy was only available in English, rather than Spanish, and the information was not clearly understandable. Techpump also required that individuals who wished to exercise their data subject rights submit their ID card information in order to verify their identity. The DPA considered this to be an unacceptable impediment to the exercise of data subject rights.

    "summary": "The Irish DPA (DPC) has fined Meta Platforms Ireland Limited EUR 390 million. The DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 210 million for violations related to the provision of its Facebook service and EUR 180 million for violations related to the provision of its Instagram service. The Austrian organization 'None of Your Business' (NOYB) had filed a complaint with the DPA on behalf of two individuals. \n\nMeta had updated its terms of service shortly before the GDPR came into force. In its new terms of service, Meta informed its users to click 'Agree and Continue' to indicate their agreement with the new terms of service. This was required for further access to the services. Meta assumed that the acceptance of the updated terms of use constituted a contract between Meta and the user, since the processing of the data would be necessary for the provision as well as the improvement of the services. According to Meta, the data processing was therefore lawful pursuant to Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR. However, the complainant argued that Meta was actually trying to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing users' data. By making the access to its services conditional on users' consent to the updated terms of service, Meta was actually forcing users to consent to the processing of their personal data. \n\nFollowing the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to other European supervisory authorities concerned. The DPC found that Meta did not rely on user consent as a legal basis, and did not consider 'coerced consent' in this case. It also did not rule out the possibility that Meta relied on a contractual legal basis. In response, the DPC received objections from different supervisory authorities. However, the DPC found that Meta had breached its transparency obligations under the GDPR, by not clearly explaining to users for what purpose and on what legal basis their personal data would be processed. \n\nAs no agreement could be reached on the disputed points, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure pursuant to Art. 65 GDPR. In its decision, the EDPB confirmed the violation of transparency obligations by Meta. However, the EDPB took a different position than the DPC on the issue of the legal basis and found that Meta was not entitled to rely on a contractual legal basis. The EDPB therefore found that Meta had violated Art. 6 (1) GDPR. The DPC agreed in its final decision and imposed the fine and also required Meta to bring its data processing into compliance within three months.",

    "summary": "The Irish DPA (DPC) has fined WhatsApp Ireland Ltd. EUR 5.5 million. The Austrian organization 'None of Your Business' (NOYB) had filed a complaint with the DPA on behalf of an individual. \n\nWhatsApp had updated its terms of service shortly before the GDPR came into force. In its new terms of service, WhatsApp informed its users to click 'Agree and Continue' to indicate their agreement with the new terms of service. This was required for further access to the services. WhatsApp assumed that the acceptance of the updated terms of use constituted a contract between WhatsApp and the user, since the processing of the data would be necessary for the provision as well as the improvement of the services. According to WhatsApp, the data processing was therefore lawful pursuant to Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR. However, the complainant argued that WhatsApp was actually trying to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing users' data. By making the access to its services conditional on users' consent to the updated terms of service, WhatsApp was forcing users to consent to the processing of their personal data. \n\nFollowing the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to other European supervisory authorities concerned. The DPC found that WhatsApp did not rely on user consent as a legal basis, and did not consider 'coerced consent' in this case. It also did not rule out the possibility that WhatsApp relied on a contractual legal basis. In response, the DPC received objections from different supervisory authorities. However, the DPC found that WhatsApp had breached its transparency obligations under the GDPR, by not clearly explaining to users for what purpose and on what legal basis their personal data would be processed. \n\nAs no agreement could be reached on the disputed points, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure pursuant to Art. 65 GDPR. In its decision, the EDPB confirmed the violation of transparency obligations by WhatsApp. However, the EDPB took a different position than the DPC on the issue of the legal basis and found that WhatsApp was not entitled to rely on a contractual legal basis. The EDPB therefore found that WhatsApp had violated Art. 6 (1) GDPR. The DPC agreed in its final decision and imposed the fine and also required WhatsApp to bring its data processing into compliance within three months.\nThe DPC agreed in its final decision and imposed the fine and also required WhatsApp to bring its data processing into compliance within six months.",

The DPA also found that the controller had not complied with the data subject's request for access to personal data in a timely manner, therefore violating Art. 15 GDPR.",

For example, customers who had only consented to telemarketing also received SMS marketing messages. \r\n\r\nFinally, the DPA found that Douglas had breached its accountability obligations regarding the processing of personal data on its blog.",

Verizon had installed GPS systems in delivery vehicles for the customer and was acting as a processor for them. During its investigation, the DPA found that the relationship between Verizon and the customer was not sufficiently regulated, contrary to the requirements of Art. 28 GDPR. The DPA therefore found that the data processed as part of the commissioned processing was consequently processed without a valid legal basis over a long period of time.",

    "summary": "The Croatian DPA (AZOP) has imposed a fine of EUR 2,265,000 on a debt collection agency. The fine is the highest ever imposed by AZOP. AZOP had received an anonymous complaint in December 2022 stating that a large number of debtors' personal data had been processed by the collection agency without authorization. Attached to the complaint was a USB stick containing personal data (name, date of birth, personal identification number) of 77,317 debtors. \n\nDuring its investigation, AZOP found that controller did not provide sufficient information about the processing of personal data in its privacy policy. Moreover, it failed to provide information about the legal basis for the refund of overpaid funds. The breach affected 132,652 individuals. \n\nFurther, the AZOP found that the controller had not entered into a data processing agreement with a processor that monitored simple consumer bankruptcies. This put the data of 83,896 individuals at risk. The breach persisted for 2 years.\n\nFinally, AZOP found that the controller had failed to implement adequate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. \nDeficiencies in the controller's security system led to insecure processing of personal data on a large scale, resulting in the unauthorized filtering of data. AZOP noted that the breach has been ongoing since at least 2019 and has not been addressed to date. \n\nAggravating factors considered by AZOP included the controller's failure to adequately cooperate with the DPA during the process. Furthermore, the controller has not yet informed AZOP of additional measures it has taken to prevent future risks of identified violations and has not yet brought its privacy policy into compliance with the GDPR.",

    "summary": "The Irish DPA (DPC) has fined Meta Platforms Ireland Limited EUR 1.2 billion. This is the highest fine imposed to date under the GDPR. In its decision, the DPC found that Meta had violated Art. 46 GDPR by continuing to transfer personal data to the U.S. after the Schrems II ruling of the CJEU. According to the Schrems II ruling, U.S. law does not provide a level of protection for personal data substantially equivalent to that provided by EU law and that the standard contractual clauses (SCCs) also do not provide sufficient protection. Meta based its data transfers on the SCCs and additional own safeguards. However, during its investigation, the DPC determined that these additional measures did not compensate for the inadequate protections provided by U.S. law. \n\nFollowing the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision to other concerned supervisory authorities pursuant to Art. 60 GDPR. In response, the DPC received objections from supervisory authorities, which led to a dispute resolution procedure before the European Data Protection Board (EDPB). In its decision, the EDPB asked the DPC to amend the proposed fine and adapt it to the seriousness of the data protection breach.\n\nThe DPC also ordered to cease any future transfer of personal data to the U.S., as well as to cease storage, within six months, of data already transferred to the U.S.\n\nMeta has announced that it will appeal the ruling and seek a suspension of the orders in court.",

AZOP had received a complaint from a data subject, stating that the controller had obtained a copy of their bank card. \r\n\r\nDuring its investigation, AZOP found that the controller had collected personal data (including copies of bank cards) of data subjects without a valid legal basis. In 2022, players had the option to have their winnings paid out not only via their bank account but also via their Visa card. The controller collected copies of the bank cards with the intention of complying with requirements of the national Money Laundering Act. However, AZOP found that the collection of the copies was not necessary to comply with the requirements of the Money Laundering Act and that the processing of the data was therefore unlawful.\r\n\r\nIn this context, AZOP also found that the controller had not sufficiently informed the data subjects about the processing of their personal data, in particular, it was expressly stated that the data controller does not store bank card numbers and that the numbers are not accessible to the unauthorized persons. Accordingly, the information provided to the data subjects was missing information on the legal basis, purpose of collection and retention period of the personal data. \r\n\r\nThe controller also failed to take sufficient technical and organizational measures to protect personal data relating to the establishment of payment processes via Visa bank cards, as well as for the storage of data contained in the controller's databases. \r\n\r\nAs a result, in 2022 the controller collected copies of a total of 2078 bank cards, of which 655 copies were fully accessible. \r\n\r\nIn assessing the fine amount, AZOP took into account as an aggravating factor that financial data is particularly sensitive data and the controller therefore should have taken special measures to protect it. \r\n\r\nAs a mitigating circumstance, it was taken into account that the controller had announced that it would bring its processing procedures in line with the GDPR and had deleted all secured copies of the bank cards.",
