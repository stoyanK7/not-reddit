# Choose styling framework

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Developing a UI for the application is a tedious task. The UI does not have to be anything special
since the focus of this project is on higher level architecture. We need to choose a styling
framework that will help us to develop the UI faster and easier since time is of essence in this
project.

## Decision

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is chosen as the styling framework. It offers better
flexibility than _Bootstrap_ and _Material UI_ and is easier to use than _SASS_. Previous experience
with _TailwindCSS_ is also a factor in the decision.

## Consequences

Development will be faster and easier.
